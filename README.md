# StudentGradePredictor
This project takes the data of scores of mathematics for two schools in Europe.
We tried to solve both the regression problem and classification problem.
Regression problem is done by trying the predict the final marks achieved by a student.
Classification problem can be answered if we can decide a student can pass or fail in the final exam.
Considered different models for both regression and classification, then we compared the results and chose the best one for each problem.
